Since the only way to login is enter the OTP, I put static way for 15 seconds while I automate and I enter the OTP manually.
After 15 seconds automation is going on. 
I wrote my phone number in properties file globally. 
Anyone needs to change the phone number to verify my codes and to enter the OTP manually in the waiting time
